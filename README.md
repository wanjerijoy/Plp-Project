This project is a comprehensive real estate management website designed to streamline the processes of buying, selling, and renting properties. It offers a user-friendly interface where users can securely register and log in, browse and search for properties using various filters, view detailed property listings with photos and descriptions, and contact property owners directly. Property owners can list their properties and manage their listings through a personal dashboard, while administrators can oversee the entire platform via an admin panel that includes user and property management functionalities. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React on the frontend, and Node.js with Express on the backend, the website uses MongoDB for database management and incorporates JWT and bcrypt for secure user authentication. The responsive design ensures accessibility across both mobile and desktop devices. To set up the project locally, clone the repository, install dependencies, configure environment variables, and start the development server. Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome.
